# bukkit-click-debug
Sends a message to console when certain items are interacted with - a simple (quickly written) debug plugin which has almost no practical use. 

This plugin will log messages to console when certain items are clicked.
Items which log information can be added in the config.yml generated when the plugin is first run.
